It is an extra plus if its a queer mythology novel such as the The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller. I love seeing queer poc representation like that in Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston. If you have an book recommendations feel free to send them my way :)"

The concept is a perfect intersection between environmental science and social justice, tackling concepts such as environmental justice. My interest was sparked from Exide toxic dumping in South East Los Angeles. I feel strongly about companies taking advantage of the environment and communities of color for their own capital gains. "
