            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>
              With the rise of chess interest after Netflix’s The Queen’s
              Gambit, BetMate aims to capitalize on the chess interest
              through a chess specific betting platform, offering a new way of
              engaging with chess matches through betting on each move
              and outcomes of each match. The platform allows users to
              compete with other betters to earn virtual tokens!
            </p>

            <h4>Timeframe:</h4>
            <p>
              Approximately 8 Weeks

        <h2> Chess Betting Reimagined </h2>
        <div> </div>
        <p>BetMate aims to captialize on the refound interest in chess made within the last year.
          User’s are given virtual currency to place bets on chess games, either on specific moves or the overall
          outcome of the match, from our extensive database. This case study closely examines the user research
          required for users’ interaction with our mechanism, pool betting, and for the platform as
          well as my own personal growth through BetMate’s rebranding.

          <h2>Uncovering our Competitors </h2>
          <div />
          <p>With a large market already in the field of chess when looking for competitiors we focused
            on <em>three main areas: chess, betting, and the intersection of the two.</em> Industry
            research allows us as designers to begin to understand the complexities of chess and betting.
            A key insight was that there were limited options for betting on chess tournaments.

            <h2>User Interviews Key Insights</h2>
            <div />
            <p>The candidates given for the user interviews were primarily <em>chess oriented</em>. Though we got a deeper
              understanding of the needs of chess players of all levels, our research fell a bit short when it came to fully
              understanding betting. However, our partners offered the team valuable insight into the overlapping world of
              chess betting. From user interviews we were able to narrow down our persona to the <em>intrigued amateur.</em>
              Though we were compelled to cater to a competitive and exeprienced autdience, since Betmate is an up and coming
              platform we wanted to <em>cater to as many audiences as possible.</em> This user would need more guidance as to how chess
              and betting overlap and a <em>simplified betting flow.</em> More experienced betters wanted more <em>flexibility</em> in their betting experience.

        <p>We mapped out the <em>user flow </em> for the BetMate platform, breaking down users’ thoughts and emotions throughout
          each step. I focused heavily on the <em>betting flow</em> for users during a chess game and ensuring an enjoyable
          <em>user experience.</em>

        <h2>Drawing it out</h2>
        <div />
        <p>After inital user research, the design team moved forward with the design process with <em>Google’s Crazy 8’s process.</em>
          We entered with a creative freedom mentality. I used a thick pencil brush on my iPad in order to <em>avoid spending too much time on the finer details. </em>
          Afterwards, I went back to annotate the core functionality of each sketch. The Crazy 8’s process is fun and messy, allowing designers to focus solely on functionality,
          and I chose to focus on the in-game betting functionality. After <em>dot voting</em> as a team, we moved foward with the following crazy 8s:

          <img src="" alt="" width="" />
        </div>
        <p>As we prepared to share with the rest of the DALI Lab, our team found ourselves stuck on betting functionality. Users were allowed to choose a betting amount; however,
          we were torn between offering <em>tokens</em> to respresent the betting amount, or a <em>slider.</em> We were also perplexed by the the challenge of <em>displaying the bets</em>
          allowed to the user.

          <h2>Our Betting Mechanism </h2>
          <div />
          <p>As we moved into greyscales, our design team had to sit down with the partners to understand the <em>betting mechanisms</em> that we would be implementing.
            Once understanding how <em>pool betting</em> would be incorporated into the platform, we decided as a team to display the possible betting options
            <em>ranked by popularity.</em> Another important point of the betting process was the <em>token v. slider</em>. After continous iterations, the team presented
            Iteration 1 & 2 to the designers of the DALI lab. Each betting flow was designed with the <em> time constraints</em> of quick chess moves
            as well as <em>user engagement and simplifying the complexities of betting</em> . After receiving feedback, we decided to iterate more and move forward with Iteration 3, a
            <em> combination of both with the token betting mechanisim and horizontal display of betting options </em> . This gamified the betting expereince for the user allowing for
            continuous interaction.

        <h2>UX Key Insightss</h2>
        <div />
        <p>Reflecting on the challenge of solidifying a solid UX for this chess betting project was an enormous feat as neither I nor my design partner and mentor had any chess or betting expereince.
          Though we struggled to understand the functionality of pool betting and house betting intitally, <em>the mulitple iterations</em> that followed clearly targeted the pain points of users
          (limited time, knowledge of
          chess notation and betting odds, and being overwhelmed) while emphasizing a delightful user expereince. Asking for help and clarifying any confusion through <em>detailed communcation</em>
          with our partners was vital. <em>Communication internally</em> between my design partner, mentor, and I was crucial as I was new to the designer role in the lab.

        <h2>Discover Color</h2>
        <div />
        <p>After greyscales, our team moved forward to <em>refine</em> the screens through <em>high fidelity (hi-fi)</em> designs. We were initially set on staying on course with a
          <em> dark UI</em> , specifcially with colors that corresponded to the given <em>original logo (below)</em> , and gradients. We received feedback that the UI was very
          <em> monochrome</em>  giving a structured and data driven
          impression. We took that feedback and decided to explore color
          combinations to interact with a broader audience. After curating a mood board, we iterated multiple times to present various routes to take the plafrom.
          We created a <em>pastel iteration</em> with large background
          graphics and a <em> neon centered UI</em>. For both iterations we attempted to use emojis to cater to <em>various audiences</em> and use a <em>universal language</em>.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>After recieving feedback, we decided to move forward with the <em>neon and gradient</em> focused
          designs because it created a more <em>cohesive style</em> with the dark UI. The other pastel graphic
          designs distracted the user from the main chess betting content. When implementing the style
          throughout the <em> betting mechanism designs</em>, we were torn between the using the <em> money bag emoji v. a token vector</em>.

            User Testing
          </h2>
          <p> Once all of the screens were designed and prototyped, user testing brought to light the need for
            consistency with emojis thus we moved forward with the money bag emoji as the betting currency,
            as shown below. User testing also brought forth a need to focus on typography and the finer detail like betting odds displays.

        <h2>UI Recap</h2>
        <p>As a designer, this project pushed my UI comfort zone. I felt comfortable and strong
          with the monochrome gradients, but after taking a step back to reflect on our <em>target auidence</em>,
          I found that the need for color to attract a broader audience was neccessary. One thing that helped me
          grow through this process was looking at how dark UI interacted with colors. With our team we gathered
          <em>inspiration</em> from current dark UI platforms and found a high number of neon gradrients among the designs.
          We realized that uniform <em>high brightness and saturation</em> gradients created a cohesiveness against the dark UI across screens.
